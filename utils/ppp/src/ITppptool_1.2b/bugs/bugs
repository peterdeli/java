- hangs if no password entered ( I'm assuming AGNS accounts )

- connections scripts run on non-SWAN connection

- ~/.ppptool/connect.script is owned by root and is world readable.

- We need to provide additional options to pppd via the GUI. For example,
  novj, nocomp, plink etc. This should probably be a per-account option.

- ppptool blows away for no obvious reason shortly after connecting.


RFE

- auto-save option ( on by default )

- better logging ( and document '-debug' option )

- Don't allow vpn client to kill pppd

- When setting up an account, defaultroute should be set by default (as per spec)
- an option to mark an account as a Sun modem pool.  If this is marked, 
different fields will be "required" and different defaults set (like Token 
card) and other options grayed out.  This also ties into whether the 
connection scripts are run or not.

- with regards to the password for the connection, the connect button 
should not be "active" until a password is entered/available.

- with regards to the autosave, there should be a  save button as well as a close on the Account Manager screen.

* default port speed should not be 9600.  I would set it to 57600 which 
works with 28.8 modems.  115200 works with 56K modems in my testing.

* RFE: fix up root requirements; only do what you have to as root.  You 
should not need ro be root to call pppd if you have set up the 
/etc/ppp/options file correctly as part of the pkg.   This is listed in the 
Spec.  To refresh your memory :)

If pppd is not being run as root, user's have much more control over it.

* RFE: remove blinking lights.  It gives the impression of activity even if 
there is none.  I would only have them blinking during the initial 
connection.

* User's password is in cleartext in the Edit Account screen.
