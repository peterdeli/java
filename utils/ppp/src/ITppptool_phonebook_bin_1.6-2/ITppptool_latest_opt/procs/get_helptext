\n\n\
<b>VII.  Connecting with PPPtool\n\
\n\
To initiate a connection, follow these steps:\n\
1. Select an account and make it active ( See V. above )\n\
2. Make sure your modem is connected to the correct port, and that the correct cable is connected between the modem and the computer.\n\
3. Verify the account information is correct, then click on the 'Connect' Button.\n\
4. If possible, turn up the volume on the modem so that you can hear it going off-hook, dialing, and connecting.\n\
5. Monitor the 'Status' line at the bottom of the main window, and the log window ( File/View Log )\n\ 
<b>VIIa. Connecting to Sun Modempools  with a tokencard\n\  
For Sun Modempool connections, there will be instructions during the connection on when to key in numbers into your tokencard, as well as when to enter to tokencard responses into the ppptool tokencard dialog.\n\
First, click the 'Connect' button. PPPtool will initialize the modem and then dial the modempool number.\n\
During this time, a window will appear with some instructions to prepare your tokencard by entering the tokencard password, and waiting for a 'challenge' ( consisting of '9' followed by four numbers. )\n\
If the initial authentication is successful, PPPtool will be connected and will then receive a 'Challenge' sequence of numbers from the ModemPool Server.\n\
This will be displayed as in the 'Tokencard Challenge/Response' window.\n\
Enter these numbers into the tokencard and press 'E' as in the instructions in the window.\n\
The tokencard will then respond with a string of alpha-numeric characters.\n\
Enter the string into the Tokencard Challenge/Response field and click 'Send Response' or press 'Enter'.\n\n\
If the response entered into the Tokencard Challenge/Response window is correct, PPPtool will be logged into Sun.\n\
If no response is entered within the time limit, the PPPtool log window will indicate this ( File/View Log ).\n\
