Hi Peter

Here is some more ppptool stuff:

- When setting up an account, defaultroute should be set by default (as per 
spec)
- an option to mark an account as a Sun modem pool.  If this is marked, 
different fields will be "required" and different defaults set (like Token 
card) and other options grayed out.  This also ties into whether the 
connection scripts are run or not.
- with regards to the password for the connection, the connect button 
should not be "active" until a password is entered/available.
- with regards to the autosave, there should be a  save button as well as a 
close on the Account Manager screen.
